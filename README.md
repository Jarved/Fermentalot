# Fermentalot
A DIY controller for homebrew fermenting. Using a Raspberry PI and CDP Studio for SW development. 

This repository is going to be used in my effort to design and develop a controller for fermenting my home brews. Have done this an Arduino Mega 2560 
board with temperature sensors, relays to turn on/off heating elements and logging to SD-card on board. 
This setup does also communicate with Blynk for status monitoring and controlling via app on my iphone.

In this new setup I will try to use a Raspberry Pi 3b+ to try to develop a user interface.

If I will succeed? Do not know... :-)

Do not have any experience in programming Raspberry. No experience with the CDP Studio either, but it seems to be the
perfect alternative for this project. Next project will be to do the same with the brewing controller as well.
